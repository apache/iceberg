/**
 * SplitAssigner interface is extracted out as a separate component so that we can plug in different
 * split assignment strategy for different requirements. E.g.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Simple assigner with no ordering guarantee or locality aware optimization.
 *   <li>Locality aware assigner that prefer splits that are local.
 *   <li>Snapshot aware assigner that assign splits based on the order they are committed.
 *   <li>Event time alignment assigner that assign splits satisfying certain time ordering within a
 *       single source or across sources.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Assigner implementation needs to be thread safe. Enumerator call the assigner APIs mostly from
 * the coordinator thread. But enumerator may call the {@link SplitAssigner#pendingSplitCount()}
 * from the I/O threads.

/**
 * An action that removes orphan metadata and data files by listing a given location and comparing
 * the actual files in that location with data and metadata files referenced by all valid snapshots.
 * The location must be accessible for listing via the Hadoop {@link FileSystem}.
 * <p>
 * By default, this action cleans up the table location returned by {@link Table#location()} and
 * removes unreachable files that are older than 3 days using {@link Table#io()}. The behavior can be modified
 * by passing a custom location to {@link #location} and a custom timestamp to {@link #olderThan(long)}.
 * For example, someone might point this action to the data folder to clean up only orphan data files.
 * In addition, there is a way to configure an alternative delete method via {@link #deleteWith(Consumer)}.
 * <p>
 * <em>Note:</em> It is dangerous to call this action with a short retention interval as it might corrupt
 * the state of the table if another operation is writing at the same time.
 *
 * @deprecated since 0.12.0, will be removed in 0.13.0; use {@link RemoveOrphanFiles} instead.

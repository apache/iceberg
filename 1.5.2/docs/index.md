# Documentation

**Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets.** Iceberg adds tables to compute engines including Spark, Trino, PrestoDB, Flink, Hive and Impala using a high-performance table format that works just like a SQL table.

### User experience

Iceberg avoids unpleasant surprises. Schema evolution works and won't inadvertently un-delete data. Users don't need to know about partitioning to get fast queries.

* [Schema evolution](evolution.md#schema-evolution) supports add, drop, update, or rename, and has [no side-effects](evolution.md#correctness)
* [Hidden partitioning](partitioning.md) prevents user mistakes that cause silently incorrect results or extremely slow queries
* [Partition layout evolution](evolution.md#partition-evolution) can update the layout of a table as data volume or query patterns change
* [Time travel](spark-queries.md#time-travel) enables reproducible queries that use exactly the same table snapshot, or lets users easily examine changes
* Version rollback allows users to quickly correct problems by resetting tables to a good state

### Reliability and performance

Iceberg was built for huge tables. Iceberg is used in production where a single table can contain tens of petabytes of data and even these huge tables can be read without a distributed SQL engine.

* [Scan planning is fast](performance.md#scan-planning) -- a distributed SQL engine isn't needed to read a table or find files
* [Advanced filtering](performance.md#data-filtering) -- data files are pruned with partition and column-level stats, using table metadata

Iceberg was designed to solve correctness problems in eventually-consistent cloud object stores.

* [Works with any cloud store](reliability.md) and reduces NN congestion when in HDFS, by avoiding listing and renames
* [Serializable isolation](reliability.md) -- table changes are atomic and readers never see partial or uncommitted changes
* [Multiple concurrent writers](reliability.md#concurrent-write-operations) use optimistic concurrency and will retry to ensure that compatible updates succeed, even when writes conflict

### Open standard

Iceberg has been designed and developed to be an open community standard with a [specification](../../spec.md) to ensure compatibility across languages and implementations.

[Apache Iceberg is open source](../../community.md), and is developed at the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/).

# Reporting Security Issues

The Apache Iceberg Project uses the standard process outlined by the [Apache
Security Team](https://www.apache.org/security/) for reporting vulnerabilities.
Note that vulnerabilities should not be publicly disclosed until the project has
responded.

To report a possible security vulnerability, please email <a href="mailto:security@iceberg.apache.org">security@iceberg.apache.org</a>.

# Feature Support

The goal is that the python library will provide a functional, performant subset of the Java library. The initial focus has been on reading table metadata and provide a convenient CLI to go through the catalog.

## Metadata

| Operation                | Java  | Python |
|:-------------------------|:-----:|:------:|
| Get Schema               |    X  |   X    |
| Get Snapshots            |    X  |   X    |
| Plan Scan                |    X  |   X    |
| Plan Scan for Snapshot   |    X  |   X    |
| Update Current Snapshot  |    X  |        |
| Create Table             |    X  |   X    |
| Rename Table             |    X  |   X    |
| Drop Table               |    X  |   X    |
| Alter Table              |    X  |        |
| Set Table Properties     |    X  |        |
| Create Namespace         |    X  |   X    |
| Drop Namespace           |    X  |   X    |
| Set Namespace Properties |    X  |   X    |

# Verifying a release

Each Apache PyIceberg release is validated by the community by holding a vote. A community release manager will prepare a release candidate and call a vote on the Iceberg dev list. To validate the release candidate, community members will test it out in their downstream projects and environments.

In addition to testing in downstream projects, community members also check the release’s signatures, checksums, and license documentation.

## Validating a release candidate

Release announcements include links to the following:

- A source tarball
- A signature (.asc)
- A checksum (.sha512)
- KEYS file
- GitHub change comparison

After downloading the source tarball, signature, checksum, and KEYS file, here are instructions on how to verify signatures, checksums, and documentation.

## Verifying signatures

First, import the keys.

```sh
curl https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/iceberg/KEYS -o KEYS
gpg --import KEYS
```

Next, verify the `.asc` file.

```sh
gpg --verify pyiceberg-0.2.0rc0-py3-none-any.whl.asc pyiceberg-0.2.0rc0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Verifying checksums

```sh
shasum -a 512 pyiceberg-0.2.0rc0.tar.gz
```

## Verifying License Documentation

```sh
tar xzf pyiceberg-0.2.0rc0.tar.gztar
cd pyiceberg-0.2.0
```

Run RAT checks to validate license header:

```
./dev/check-license
```

## Testing

First step is to install the package:

```sh
make install
```

And then run the tests:

```sh
make test
```

To run the full integration tests:

```sh
make test-s3
```

This will include a Minio S3 container being spun up.

# Cast the vote

Votes are cast by replying to the release candidate announcement email on the dev mailing list with either `+1`, `0`, or `-1`.

In addition to your vote, it’s customary to specify if your vote is binding or non-binding. Only members of the Project Management Committee have formally binding votes. If you’re unsure, you can specify that your vote is non-binding. To read more about voting in the Apache framework, checkout the [Voting](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html) information page on the Apache foundation’s website.

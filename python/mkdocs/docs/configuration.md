# Catalogs

PyIceberg currently has native support for REST, Hive and Glue.

There are three ways to pass in configuration:

- Using the `~/.pyiceberg.yaml` configuration file
- Through environment variables
- By passing in credentials through the CLI or the Python API

The configuration file is recommended since that's the most transparent way. If you prefer environment configuration:

```sh
export PYICEBERG_CATALOG__DEFAULT__URI=thrift://localhost:9083
```

The environment variable picked up by Iceberg starts with `PYICEBERG_` and then follows the yaml structure below, where a double underscore `__` represents a nested field.

## FileIO

Iceberg works with the concept of a FileIO which is a pluggable module for reading, writing, and deleting files. By default, PyIceberg will try to initialize the FileIO that's suitable for the scheme (`s3://`, `gs://`, etc.) and will use the first one that's installed.

- **s3**, **s3a**, **s3n**: `PyArrowFileIO`, `FsspecFileIO`
- **gs**: `PyArrowFileIO`
- **file**: `PyArrowFileIO`
- **hdfs**: `PyArrowFileIO`
- **abfs**, **abfss**: `FsspecFileIO`

You can also set the FileIO explicitly:

| Key                  | Example                          | Description                                                                                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| py-io-impl           | pyiceberg.io.fsspec.FsspecFileIO | Sets the FileIO explicitly to an implementation, and will fail explicitly if it can't be loaded |

For the FileIO there are several configuration options available:

### S3

| Key                      | Example             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| s3.endpoint              | https://10.0.19.25/ | Configure an alternative endpoint of the S3 service for the FileIO to access. This could be used to use S3FileIO with any s3-compatible object storage service that has a different endpoint, or access a private S3 endpoint in a virtual private cloud. |
| s3.access-key-id         | admin               | Configure the static secret access key used to access the FileIO.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| s3.secret-access-key     | password            | Configure the static session token used to access the FileIO.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| s3.signer                | bearer              | Configure the signature version of the FileIO.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| adlfs.endpoint           | http://127.0.0.1/   | Configure an alternative endpoint of the ADLFS service for the FileIO to access.

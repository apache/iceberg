# PyIceberg

PyIceberg is a Python implementation for accessing Iceberg tables, without the need of a JVM.

## Install

You can install the latest release version from pypi:

```sh
pip3 install "pyiceberg[s3fs,hive]"
```

Install it directly for Github (not recommended), but sometimes handy:

```
pip install "git+https://github.com/apache/iceberg.git#subdirectory=python&egg=pyiceberg[s3fs]"
```

Or clone the repository for local development:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apache/iceberg.git
cd iceberg/python
pip3 install -e ".[s3fs,hive]"
```

You can mix and match optional dependencies depending on your needs:

| Key     | Description:                                                         |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| hive    | Support for the Hive metastore                                       |
| glue    | Support for AWS Glue                                                 |
| pyarrow | PyArrow as a FileIO implementation to interact with the object store |
| duckdb  | Installs both PyArrow and DuckDB                                     |
| s3fs    | S3FS as a FileIO implementation to interact with the object store    |
| snappy  | Support for snappy Avro compression                                  |

You either need to install `s3fs` or `pyarrow` for fetching files.

There is both a [CLI](cli.md) and [Python API](api.md) available.

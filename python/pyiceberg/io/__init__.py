"""Base FileIO classes for implementing reading and writing table files

The FileIO abstraction includes a subset of full filesystem implementations. Specifically,
Iceberg needs to read or write a file at a given location (as a seekable stream), as well
as check if a file exists. An implementation of the FileIO abstract base class is responsible
for returning an InputFile instance, an OutputFile instance, and deleting a file given
its location.

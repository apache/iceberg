Contains Codecs for Python Avro.

Note that the word "codecs" means "compression/decompression algorithms" in the
Avro world (https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#Object+Container+Files),
so don't confuse it with the Python's "codecs", which is a package mainly for
converting character sets (https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html).

/**
 * A writer capable of writing to multiple specs and partitions that keeps files for each seen
 * spec/partition pair open until this writer is closed.
 *
 * <p>As opposed to {@link ClusteredWriter}, this writer does not require the incoming records to be
 * clustered by partition spec and partition as all files are kept open. As a consequence, this
 * writer may potentially consume substantially more memory compared to {@link ClusteredWriter}. Use
 * this writer only when clustering by spec/partition is not possible (e.g. streaming).

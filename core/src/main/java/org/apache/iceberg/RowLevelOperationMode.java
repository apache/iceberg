/**
 * Iceberg supports two ways to modify records in a table: copy-on-write and merge-on-read.
 *
 * <p>In copy-on-write, changes are materialized immediately and matching data files are replaced
 * with new data files that represent the new table state. For example, if there is a record that
 * has to be deleted, the data file that contains this record has to be replaced with another data
 * file without that record. All unchanged rows have to be copied over to the new data file.
 *
 * <p>In merge-on-read, changes aren't materialized immediately. Instead, IDs of deleted and updated
 * records are written into delete files that are applied during reads and updated/inserted records
 * are written into new data files that are committed together with the delete files.
 *
 * <p>Copy-on-write changes tend to consume more time and resources during writes but don't
 * introduce any performance overhead during reads. Merge-on-read operations, on the other hand,
 * tend to be much faster during writes but require more time and resources to apply delete files
 * during reads.

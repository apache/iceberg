   * <p>Implementations must check that the base metadata is current to avoid overwriting updates.
   * Once the atomic commit operation succeeds, implementations must not perform any operations that
   * may fail because failure in this method cannot be distinguished from commit failure.
   *
   * <p>Implementations must throw a {@link
   * org.apache.iceberg.exceptions.CommitStateUnknownException} in cases where it cannot be
   * determined if the commit succeeded or failed. For example if a network partition causes the
   * confirmation of the commit to be lost, the implementation should throw a
   * CommitStateUnknownException. This is important because downstream users of this API need to
   * know whether they can clean up the commit or not, if the state is unknown then it is not safe
   * to remove any files. All other exceptions will be treated as if the commit has failed.

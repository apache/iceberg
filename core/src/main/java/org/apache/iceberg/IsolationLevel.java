/**
 * An isolation level in a table.
 * <p>
 * Two isolation levels are supported: serializable and snapshot isolation. Both of them provide
 * a read consistent view of the table to all operations and allow readers to see only already
 * committed data. While serializable is the strongest isolation level in databases,
 * snapshot isolation is beneficial for environments with many concurrent writers.
 * <p>
 * The serializable isolation level guarantees that an ongoing UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE operation
 * fails if a concurrent transaction commits a new file that might contain rows matching
 * the condition used in UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE. For example, if there is an ongoing update
 * on a subset of rows and a concurrent transaction adds a new file with records
 * that potentially match the update condition, the update operation must fail under
 * the serializable isolation but can still commit under the snapshot isolation.

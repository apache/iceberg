# Feature Support

The goal is that the python library will provide a functional, performant subset of the java library. The initial focus has been on reading table metadata as well as providing the capability to both plan and execute a scan.

## Feature Comparison

### Metadata

| Operation               | Java  | Python |
|:------------------------|:-----:|:------:|
| Get Schema              |    X  |    X   |
| Get Snapshots           |    X  |    X   |
| Plan Scan               |    X  |    X   |
| Plan Scan for Snapshot  |    X  |    X   |
| Update Current Snapshot |    X  |        |
| Set Table Properties    |    X  |        |
| Create Table            |    X  |        |
| Drop Table              |    X  |        |
| Alter Table             |    X  |        |


### Read Support

Pyarrow is used for reading parquet files, so read support is limited to what is currently supported in the pyarrow.parquet package.

There is a [gap](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-1644) in the current implementation that nested fields are only supported if they are:
> all repeated all repeated (lists) or all groups (structs) vs. a mix (structs and lists/repeated fields) then we can read and write them(otherwise we cannot)

#### Primitive Types


| Data Type               | Java | Python |
|:------------------------|:----:|:------:|
| BooleanType             |   X  |    X   |
| DateType                |   X  |    X   |
| DecimalType             |   X  |    X   |
| FloatType               |   X  |    X   |
| IntegerType             |   X  |    X   |
| LongType                |   X  |    X   |
| TimeType                |   X  |    X   |
| TimestampType           |   X  |    X   |

#### Nested Types

| Data Type               | Java | Python |
|:------------------------|:----:|:------:|
| ListType of primitives  |   X  |    X   |
| MapType of primitives   |   X  |    X   |
| StructType of primitives|   X  |    X   |
| ListType of Nested Types|   X  |        |
| MapType of Nested Types |   X  |        |

### Write Support

The python client does not currently support write capability

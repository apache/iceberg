# Schemas

Iceberg tables support the following types:

| Type               | Description                                                              | Notes                                            |

| **`int`**          | 32-bit signed integers                                                   | Can promote to `long`                            |
| **`long`**         | 64-bit signed integers                                                   |                                                  |
| **`float`**        | [32-bit IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floating point | Can promote to `double`                          |
| **`double`**       | [64-bit IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floating point |                                                  |
| **`decimal(P,S)`** | Fixed-point decimal; precision P, scale S                                | Scale is fixed and precision must be 38 or less  |
| **`date`**         | Calendar date without timezone or time                                   |                                                  |
| **`time`**         | Time of day without date, timezone                                       | Stored as microseconds                           |
| **`timestamp`**    | Timestamp without timezone                                               | Stored as microseconds                           |

| **`map<K, V>`**    | A map with keys and values of any data type                              |                                                  |

Iceberg tracks each field in a table schema using an ID that is never reused in a table. See [correctness guarantees](../evolution#correctness) for more information.

## Two Full Days of Apache Iceberg

Following the tremendous success of the first in-person Iceberg Summit in 2025, we're excited to expand the event to **TWO full in-person days** for 2026. The community showed up in incredible ways last year, and we're ready to make this year even bigger and better.

This third edition of Iceberg Summit is sanctioned by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) with oversight from the Apache Iceberg™ PMC. The event is dedicated to sharing practical knowledge about using Apache Iceberg as the foundation of a modern data stack, bringing together practitioners, data engineers, and developers—from the highly experienced to the "Iceberg-curious."

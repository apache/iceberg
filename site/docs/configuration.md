### Table behavior properties

| Property                           | Default          | Description                                                   |

| Property                                      | Default  | Description                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| compatibility.snapshot-id-inheritance.enabled | false    | Enables committing snapshots without explicit snapshot IDs    |

## Catalog properties

Iceberg catalogs support using catalog properties to configure catalog behaviors. Here is a list of commonly used catalog properties:

| Property                          | Default            | Description                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| catalog-impl                      | null               | a custom `Catalog` implementation to use by an engine  |
| io-impl                           | null               | a custom `FileIO` implementation to use in a catalog   |
| warehouse                         | null               | the root path of the data warehouse                    |
| uri                               | null               | a URI string, such as Hive metastore URI               |
| clients                           | 2                  | client pool size                                       |

`HadoopCatalog` and `HiveCatalog` can access the properties in their constructors.
Any other custom catalog can access the properties by implementing `Catalog.initialize(catalogName, catalogProperties)`.
The properties can be manually constructed or passed in from a compute engine like Spark or Flink.
Spark uses its session properties as catalog properties, see more details in the [Spark configuration](./spark-configuration.md#catalog-configuration) section.
Flink passes in catalog properties through `CREATE CATALOG` statement, see more details in the [Flink](../flink/#creating-catalogs-and-using-catalogs) section.

### Lock catalog properties

Here are the catalog properties related to locking. They are used by some catalog implementations to control the locking behavior during commits.

| Property                          | Default            | Description                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| lock-impl                         | null               | a custom implementation of the lock manager, the actual interface depends on the catalog used  |
| lock.table                        | null               | an auxiliary table for locking, such as in [AWS DynamoDB lock manager](../aws/#dynamodb-for-commit-locking)  |
| lock.acquire-interval-ms          | 5 seconds          | the interval to wait between each attempt to acquire a lock  |
| lock.acquire-timeout-ms           | 3 minutes          | the maximum time to try acquiring a lock               |
| lock.heartbeat-interval-ms        | 3 seconds          | the interval to wait between each heartbeat after acquiring a lock  |
| lock.heartbeat-timeout-ms         | 15 seconds         | the maximum time without a heartbeat to consider a lock expired  |


## Hadoop configuration

The following properties from the Hadoop configuration are used by the Hive Metastore connector.

| Property                              | Default          | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| iceberg.hive.client-pool-size         | 5                | The size of the Hive client pool when tracking tables in HMS                       |
| iceberg.hive.lock-timeout-ms          | 180000 (3 min)   | Maximum time in milliseconds to acquire a lock                                     |
| iceberg.hive.lock-check-min-wait-ms   | 50               | Minimum time in milliseconds to check back on the status of lock acquisition       |
| iceberg.hive.lock-check-max-wait-ms   | 5000             | Maximum time in milliseconds to check back on the status of lock acquisition       |

Note: `iceberg.hive.lock-check-max-wait-ms` should be less than the [transaction timeout](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.txn.timeout) 
of the Hive Metastore (`hive.txn.timeout` or `metastore.txn.timeout` in the newer versions). Otherwise, the heartbeats on the lock (which happens during the lock checks) would end up expiring in the 
Hive Metastore before the lock is retried from Iceberg.

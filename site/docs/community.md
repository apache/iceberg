## Community Guidelines

### Apache Iceberg Community Guidelines

The Apache Iceberg community is built on the principles described in the [Apache Way](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/index.html) 
and all who engage with the community are expected to be respectful, open, come with the best interests of the community in mind, 
and abide by the Apache Foundation [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html). 

### Participants with Corporate Interests

A wide range of corporate entities have interests that overlap in both features and frameworks related to Iceberg and while we 
encourage engagement and contributions, the community is not a venue for marketing, solicitation, or recruitment.

Any vendor who wants to participate in the Apache Iceberg community Slack workspace should create a dedicated vendor channel 
for their organization prefixed by `vendor-`.  

This space can be used to discuss features and integration with Iceberg related to the vendor offering.  This space should not 
be used to promote competing vendor products/services or disparage other vendor offerings.  Discussion should be focused on 
questions asked by the community and not to expand/introduce/redirect users to alternate offerings.

### Marketing / Solicitation / Recruiting

The Apache Iceberg community is a space for everyone to operate free of influence.  The development lists, slack workspace, 
and github should not be used to market products or services.  Solicitation or overt promotion should not be performed in common 
channels or through direct messages.

Recruitment of community members should not be conducted through direct messages or community channels, but opportunities 
related to contributing to or using Iceberg can be posted to the `#jobs` channel. 

For questions regarding any of the guidelines above, please contact a PMC member

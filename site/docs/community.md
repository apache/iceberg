## Connect with Community Events

The Apache Iceberg community regularly meets for technical discussion both in-person and virtually.

### Apache Iceberg Community Calendar

The community maintains two calendar feeds:

* [Iceberg Dev Events](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=MzkwNWQ0OTJmMWI0NTBiYTA3MTJmMmFlNmFmYTc2ZWI3NTdmMTNkODUyMjBjYzAzYWE0NTI3ODg1YWRjNTYyOUBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t){:target="_blank"}: A shared calendar for all Iceberg development syncs, including the triweekly community sync, subproject syncs for Python, Rust, and Go, the Iceberg Catalog Community Sync, and other ad hoc syncs the community may want to schedule or discuss.
* [Iceberg Community Events](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=NTkzYmIwMGJmZTQ1N2QzMTkxNDEzNTBkZDI0Yzk2NGYzOWJkYmQ5ZmQyNDMyODFhODYzMmEwMDk2M2EyMWQ4NkBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t){:target="_blank"}: Events such as conferences and meetups, aimed to educate and inspire Iceberg users.

### Hosting an Apache Iceberg Meetup

Meetups related to the Apache Iceberg project are held around the globe thanks to community volunteers. Interested individuals are encouraged to host community meetups using the name **Apache Iceberg Meetup <geographical location\>** in
compliance with [Apache Software Foundation's branding and trademarks guidelines](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events.html#approval). No explicit PMC approval is required.

Hosts are required to ensure that:

1. The Apache Iceberg ecosystem should be championed in every meetup and technical session
2. All talks should be vendor-neutral and not sales pitches
3. Each meetup should have at least two talks with speakers representing different companies/organizations
4. Planned meetups ought to be brought to the attention of the [dev list](#mailing-lists)
5. All [Community Guidelines](#community-guidelines) must be respected

## Community Guidelines

### Apache Iceberg Community Guidelines

The Apache Iceberg community is built on the principles described in the [Apache Way](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/index.html)
and all who engage with the community are expected to be respectful, open, come with the best interests of the community in mind,
and abide by the Apache Software Foundation [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html).

More information specific to the Apache Iceberg community is in the next section, [the Path from Contributor to Committer](#the-path-from-contributor-to-committer).

### Participants with Corporate Interests

A wide range of corporate entities have interests that overlap in both features and frameworks related to Iceberg and while we
encourage engagement and contributions, the community is not a venue for marketing, solicitation, or recruitment.

Any vendor who wants to participate in the Apache Iceberg community Slack workspace should create a dedicated vendor channel
for their organization prefixed by `vendor-`.  

This space can be used to discuss features and integration with Iceberg related to the vendor offering.  This space should not
be used to promote competing vendor products/services or disparage other vendor offerings.  Discussion should be focused on
questions asked by the community and not to expand/introduce/redirect users to alternate offerings.

### Marketing / Solicitation / Recruiting

The Apache Iceberg community is a space for everyone to operate free of influence.  The development lists, slack workspace,
and github should not be used to market products or services.  Solicitation or overt promotion should not be performed in common
channels or through direct messages.

Recruitment of community members should not be conducted through direct messages or community channels, but opportunities
related to contributing to or using Iceberg can be posted to the `#jobs` channel.

For questions regarding any of the guidelines above, please contact a PMC member.

## The Path from Contributor to Committer

Many contributors have questions about how to become a committer. This section outlines what committers do and how they are invited.

### What are the responsibilities of a committer?

In the Iceberg project, committers are community members that can review and commit changes to Iceberg repositories. Reviewing is the primary responsibility of committers.

### How are new committers added?

Starting from the foundation guidelines, committers are nominated and discussed by the PMC, which uses a consensus vote to confirm a new committer. This vote is the only formal requirement in the Iceberg community — there are no other requirements, such as a minimum period of time or a minimum number of contributions. Similarly, there is no length of time or number of commits that automatically qualify someone to be a committer.

Committers are added when someone has built trust with PMC members that they have good judgment and are a reliable reviewer.

### What does the PMC look for?

PMC members typically look for candidates to have demonstrated a few qualities:

* **Conduct** — Committers are representatives of the project and are expected to follow the [ASF Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html).
* **Judgment** — Committers should know the areas where they are qualified to evaluate a change and when to bring in other opinions.
* **Quality** — Personal contributions are a strong signal. Contributions that don’t require major help demonstrate the context and understanding needed to reliably review changes from others. If a contributor often needs guidance, they are probably not ready to guide others.
* **Consistency** — Reviewing is the primary responsibility of a committer. A committer should demonstrate they will consistently apply their context and understanding to help contributors get changes in and ensure those changes are high quality.

### How do I demonstrate those qualities?

To be a committer, a candidate should act like a committer so that PMC members can evaluate the qualities above. PMC members will ask questions like these:

* Has the candidate been a good representative of the project in mailing lists, Slack, github, and other discussion forums?
* Has the candidate followed the ASF Code of Conduct when working with others?
* Has the candidate made independent material contributions to the community that show expertise?
* Have the candidate’s contributions been stable and maintainable?
* Has the candidate’s work required extensive review or significant refactoring due to misunderstandings of the project’s objectives?
* Does the candidate apply the standards and conventions of the project by following existing patterns and using already included libraries?
* Has the candidate participated in design discussions for new features?
* Has the candidate asked for help when reviewing changes outside their area of expertise?
* How diverse are the contributors that the candidate reviewed?
* Does the candidate raise potentially problematic changes to the dev list?

### How can I be a committer?

You can always reach out to PMC members for feedback and guidance if you have questions.

There is no single path to becoming a committer. For example, people contributing to Python are often implicitly trusted not to start reviewing changes to other languages. Similarly, some areas of a project require more context than others.

Keep in mind that it’s best not to compare your contributions to others. Instead, focus on demonstrating quality and judgment.

### How many contributions does it take to become a committer?

The number of contributions is not what matters — the quality of those contributions (including reviews!) is what demonstrates that a contributor is ready to be a committer.

You can always reach out to PMC members directly or using private@iceberg.apache.org for feedback and guidance if you have questions.

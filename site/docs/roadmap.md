# Roadmap Overview

This roadmap outlines projects that the Iceberg community is working on, their priority, and a rough size estimate.
This is based on the latest [community priority discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r84e80216c259c81f824c6971504c321cd8c785774c489d52d4fc123f%40%3Cdev.iceberg.apache.org%3E).
Each high-level item links to a Github project board that tracks the current status.
Related design docs will be linked on the planning boards.

## REST Catalog API Specification

Iceberg defines a REST-based Catalog API for managing table metadata and performing catalog operations. You can find the OpenAPI specification here:
[REST Catalog OpenAPI YAML](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml).

You can also explore the API interactively using the [Swagger UI](https://editor-next.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/iceberg/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml).

## REST Catalog Protocol

As the Iceberg project grew to support more languages and engines, pluggable catalogs started to cause some practical problems. Catalogs needed to be implemented in multiple languages and it proved difficult for commercial offerings to support many different catalogs and clients.

To solve compatibility problems and pave a path for new features, the community created the REST catalog protocol, a common API (using the OpenAPI spec) for interacting with any Iceberg catalog. This is analogous to Hive's thrift protocol for HMS.

The REST protocol is important for several reasons:

- **Language and Engine Compatibility**: New languages and engines can support any catalog with just one client implementation.
- **Improved Reliability**: It uses change-based commits to enable server-side deconfliction and retries â€” fewer failures!
- **Simplified Metadata Management**: Metadata version upgrades are easier because root metadata is written by the catalog service.
- **Advanced Features**: It enables new features such as lazy snapshot loading, multi-table commits, and caching.
- **Security**: The protocol supports secure table sharing using credential vending or remote signing.

You can use the REST catalog protocol with any built-in catalog using translation in the `CatalogHandlers` class, or using the community maintained [`iceberg-rest-fixture`](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/iceberg-rest-fixture) docker image.

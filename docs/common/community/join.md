## Setting up IDE and Code Style

### Configuring Code Formatter for IntelliJ IDEA

In the **Settings/Preferences** dialog go to **Editor > Code Style > Java**. Click on the gear wheel and select **Import Scheme** to import IntelliJ IDEA XML code style settings.
Point to [intellij-java-palantir-style.xml](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/.baseline/idea/intellij-java-palantir-style.xml) and hit **OK** (you might need to enable **Show Hidden Files and Directories** in the dialog). The code itself can then be formatted via **Code > Reformat Code**.

See also the IntelliJ [Code Style docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/copying-code-style-settings.html) and [Reformat Code docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/reformat-and-rearrange-code.html) for additional details.

## Running Benchmarks
Some PRs/changesets might require running benchmarks to determine whether they are affecting the baseline performance. Currently there is 
no "push a single button to get a performance comparison" solution available, therefore one has to run JMH performance tests on their local machine and
post the results on the PR.

See [Benchmarks](../benchmarks) for a summary of available benchmarks and how to run them.

# REST Catalog

In Iceberg, catalogs are used to atomically track the metadata files in tables.
Iceberg support a veriaty of catalog implementations, such as Hive Metastore, AWS Glue and Project Nessie. 

In the past, every time a new catalog was supported it required re-implementing many interfaces and supporting libraries.
The REST catalog creates a universal interface to simplify existing catalog solutions.

The REST catalog is based on the [Open API specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html). 
Following this specification, the Apache Iceberg repository contains a [YAML file that specifies the REST Catalog](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml).
This allows anyone to implement their own catalog as a REST API. 
So as new catalog implementations are created, if you follow the API specification, you wonâ€™t need to create a new connector, since any engine that supports the REST API catalog implementation can also use the new catalog.

The REST catalog specification allows a server to own all of the catalog implementation details, while exposing a predictable REST API for Iceberg clients to connect to.

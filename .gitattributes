# Files marked as export-ignore will be ignored from the release's
# built via `git archive`. This simplifies the release script and 
# uses an industry standard as opposed to possibly hard to read
# shell scripts with many flags. Unfortunately, directories themselves
# won't recursively ignore, so we need the top level directories
# as well as their files.

      A quick primer on documentation in Iceberg:
      * Documentation - refers to the versioned documentation that changes with each version of Apache Iceberg, maintained [in the `docs/` directory](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/tree/main/docs).
      * Specification - refers to the core [Iceberg Specification](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/), along with the [View](https://iceberg.apache.org/view-spec/), [Puffin](https://iceberg.apache.org/puffin-spec/), and [GCM stream specifications](https://iceberg.apache.org/gcm-stream-spec/) that are maintained [in the `format/` directory](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/tree/main/format).
      * Website - refers to the non-versioned site that changes with each version of Apache Iceberg, maintained [in the `docs/` directory](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/tree/main/docs).
    By default, the `docs` and `site` labels are applied. If you have a `Specification` change, tag a committer or contributor.

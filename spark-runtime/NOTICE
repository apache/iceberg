| == Declared Project Licenses
|
| This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of dual license of
| - COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL - Version 1.1) available at
| https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/CDDL+GPL-1.1
| - GNU General Public License (GPL - Version 2, June 1991) with the "Classpath Exception"
|
| * The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
| *
| * Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street,
| * Fifth Floor Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
| *
| * Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
| * license document, but changing it is not allowed.
| *
| * Preamble
| *
| * The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
| * share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
| * intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
| * make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
| * License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
| * to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
| * Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
| * Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
| *
| * When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
| * Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
| * freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
| * service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
| * want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
| * free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
| *
| * To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
| * to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
| * restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
| * distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
| *
| * For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
| * or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
| * You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
| * And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
| *
| * We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
| * (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
| * distribute and/or modify the software.
| *
| * Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
| * that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
| * software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
| * want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
| * that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
| * authors' reputations.
| *
| * Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
| * We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
| * individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
| * proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
| * be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
| *
| * The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
| * modification follow.
| *
| * TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
| *
| * 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
| * notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
| * the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
| * to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
| * either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
| * to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
| * verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
| * (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
| * "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
| *
| * Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
| * covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
| * the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
| * covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
| * (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
| * is true depends on what the Program does.
| *
| * 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
| * code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
| * and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
| * and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
| * this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
| * recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
| *
| * You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
| * you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
| *
| * 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
| * it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
| * such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
| * that you also meet all of these conditions:
| *
| *     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
| *     that you changed the files and the date of any change.
| *
| *     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
| *     or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
| *     to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the
| *     terms of this License.
| *
| *     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
| *     run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
| *     the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
| *     appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
| *     else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
| *     redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user
| *     how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
| *     interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
| *     based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
| *
| * These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
| * identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
| * can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
| * themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
| * sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
| * distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
| * the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
| * License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
| * whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
| *
| * Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
| * your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
| * exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
| * collective works based on the Program.
| *
| * In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
| * with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
| * storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
| * scope of this License.
| *
| * 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
| * Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
| * 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
| *
| *     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
| *     code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
| *     above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
| *
| *     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
| *     give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
| *     performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
| *     corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
| *     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
| *
| *     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
| *     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
| *     for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
| *     object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
| *     Subsection b above.)
| *
| * The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
| * making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
| * means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
| * associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
| * compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
| * exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
| * normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
| * components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
| * which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
| * executable.
| *
| * If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
| * to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
| * the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
| * code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
| * along with the object code.
| *
| * 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
| * except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
| * to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
| * automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
| * who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
| * not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
| * full compliance.
| *
| * 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
| * signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
| * distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
| * prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
| * modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
| * Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
| * its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
| * Program or works based on it.
| *
| * 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
| * Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
| * original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
| * these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
| * on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
| * responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
| *
| * 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
| * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
| * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
| * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
| * excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
| * so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
| * any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
| * distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
| * not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
| * receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
| * could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
| * distribution of the Program.
| *
| * If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
| * any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
| * apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
| * circumstances.
| *
| * It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
| * patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
| * such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
| * integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
| * by public license practices. Many people have made generous
| * contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
| * system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
| * the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
| * software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
| * choice.
| *
| * This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
| * a consequence of the rest of this License.
| *
| * 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
| * certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
| * original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
| * add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
| * countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
| * not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
| * limitation as if written in the body of this License.
| *
| * 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
| * of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
| * be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
| * address new problems or concerns.
| *
| * Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
| * specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
| * later version", you have the option of following the terms and
| * conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
| * the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
| * number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
| * Free Software Foundation.
| *
| * 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
| * programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
| * author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
| * Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
| * sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
| * two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
| * software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
| *
| * NO WARRANTY
| *
| * 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
| * FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
| * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
| * PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
| * EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
| * WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
| * ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
| * YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
| * NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
| *
| * 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
| * WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
| * AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
| * DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
| * DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
| * (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
| * INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
| * THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
| * OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
| *
| * END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
| *
| * How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
| *
| * If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
| * possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
| * free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
| * terms.
| *
| * To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
| * attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
| * the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
| * "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
| *
| *     One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
| *     Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
| *
| *     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
| *     under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
| *     Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your
| *     option) any later version.
| *
| *     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
| *     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
| *     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General
| *     Public License for more details.
| *
| *     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
| *     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
| *     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
| *
| * Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
| *
| * If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
| * when it starts in an interactive mode:
| *
| *     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision
| *     comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is
| *     free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
| *     conditions; type `show c' for details.
| *
| * The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
| * appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
| * you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
| * could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
| *
| * You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
| * school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
| * necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
| *
| *     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
| *     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
| *
| *     signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
| *     Ty Coon, President of Vice
| *
| * This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
| * into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
| * may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
| * with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
| * General Public License instead of this License.
| *
| *
| *
| * "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2
| *
| * Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its affiliates
| * are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2,
| * based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the
| * GNU Classpath Exception, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the
| * particular source file's header the words "Oracle designates this particular
| * file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as provided by Oracle in the
| * LICENSE file that accompanied this code."
| *   You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in
| * this software package. Some of those programs are provided under licenses
| * deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others.
| * For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache License,
| * Version 2.0.  Such programs are licensed to you under their original licenses.
| *   Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the
| * Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits you
| * to use that code in combination with other independent modules not licensed
| * under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would not permit you to commingle
| * code under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for
| * example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also containing Oracle's
| * GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.  Additionally, if you
| * were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it
| * applies and distribute the result, you would likely be required to license
| * some or all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well,
| * and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items
| * included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath Exception could
| * therefore effectively compromise your ability to further distribute the package.
| *
| * Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer
| * skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or
| * making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed
| * and/or involve the use of third party software.
| *
| * CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
| * Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
| * combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
| * General Public License version 2 cover the whole combination.
| *
| * As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
| * permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
| * executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and
| * to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,
| * provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and
| * conditions of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module
| * which is not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify this library,
| * you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not
| * obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
| * statement from your version.

| *
| * Creative Commons Legal Code
| *
| * CC0 1.0 Universal
| *
| *    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
| *    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
| *    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
| *    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
| *    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS

| *    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
| *    HEREUNDER.
| *
| * Statement of Purpose
| *
| * The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
| * exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
| * and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
| * authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
| *
| * Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
| * the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
| * scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
| * of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
| * works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
| * and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
| * These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
| * culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
| * works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
| * part through the use and efforts of others.
| *
| * For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
| * expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
| * associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
| * is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
| * elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
| * terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
| * Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
| *
| * 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
| * protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
| * Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
| * limited to, the following:
| *
| *   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
| *      communicate, and translate a Work;
| *  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
| * iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
| *      likeness depicted in a Work;
| *  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
| *      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
| *   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
| *      in a Work;
| *  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
| *      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
| *      protection of databases, and under any national implementation
| *      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
| *      directive); and
| * vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
| *      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
| *      implementations thereof.
| *
| * 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
| * of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
| * irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
| * Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
| * of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
| * future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
| * worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
| * treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
| * medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
| * including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
| * purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
| * member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
| * successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
| * revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
| * equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
| * as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
| *
| * 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
| * be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
| * Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
| * account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
| * extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
| * person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
| * irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
| * Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
| * maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
| * time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
| * of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
| * limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
| * "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
| * applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
| * reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
| * partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
| * of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
| * will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
| * Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
| * action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
| * express Statement of Purpose.
| *
| * 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
| *
| * a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
| *    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
| * b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
| *    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
| *    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
| *    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
| *    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
| *    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
| *    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
| * c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
| *    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
| *    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
| *    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
| *    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
| *    Work.
| * d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
| *    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
| *    this CC0 or use of the Work.

| *   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
| *
| *   1. Definitions.
| *

| *      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
| *      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
| *      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
| *
| *      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
| *      exercising permissions granted by this License.
| *
| *      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
| *      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
| *      source, and configuration files.
| *
| *      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
| *      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
| *      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

| *      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
| *
| *      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
| *      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
| *      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

| *      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
| *      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
| *      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
| *
| *      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

| *      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
| *      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
| *      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
| *      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
| *      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
| *      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
| *      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
| *      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

| *
| *      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
| *      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
| *      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
| *
| *   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
| *      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
| *      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
| *      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
| *      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
| *      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
| *
| *   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
| *      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
| *      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
| *      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
| *      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
| *      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
| *      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
| *      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
| *      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
| *      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
| *      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
| *      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
| *      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
| *      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
| *      as of the date such litigation is filed.
| *
| *   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
| *      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
| *      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
| *      meet the following conditions:
| *
| *      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
| *          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
| *
| *      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
| *          stating that You changed the files; and
| *
| *      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
| *          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
| *          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
| *          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
| *          the Derivative Works; and
| *
| *      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
| *          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
| *          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
| *          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
| *          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
| *          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
| *          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
| *          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
| *          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
| *          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
| *          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
| *          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
| *          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
| *          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
| *          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
| *          as modifying the License.
| *
| *      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
| *      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
| *      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
| *      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
| *      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
| *      the conditions stated in this License.
| *
| *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
| *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
| *      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
| *      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
| *      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
| *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
| *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
| *
| *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
| *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
| *      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
| *      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
| *
| *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
| *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
| *      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
| *      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
| *      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
| *      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
| *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
| *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
| *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
| *
| *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
| *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
| *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
| *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
| *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
| *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
| *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
| *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
| *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
| *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
| *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
| *
| *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
| *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
| *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
| *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
| *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
| *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
| *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
| *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
| *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
| *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

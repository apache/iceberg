/**
 * Enum of supported write distribution mode, it defines the write behavior of batch or streaming job:
 * <p>
 * 1. none: don't shuffle rows. It is suitable for scenarios where the rows are located in only few
 * partitions, otherwise that may produce too many small files because each task is writing rows into different
 * partitions randomly.
 * <p>
 * 2. hash: hash distribute by partition key, which is suitable for the scenarios where the rows are located
 * into different partitions evenly.
 * <p>
 * 3. range: range distribute by partition key (or sort key if table has an {@link SortOrder}), which is suitable
 * for the scenarios where rows are located into different partitions with skew distribution.

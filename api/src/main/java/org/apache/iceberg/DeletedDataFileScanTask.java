 * A scan task for deletes generated by removing a data file from the table.

 * file. This is required to output only those data records that were live when the data file was
 * removed.
 *
 * <p>Suppose snapshot S1 contains data files F1, F2, F3. Then snapshot S2 adds a position delete
 * file, D1, that deletes records from F2 and snapshot S3 removes F2 entirely. A scan for changes
 * generated by S3 should include the following task:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>DeletedDataFileScanTask(file=F2, existing-deletes=[D1], snapshot=S3)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Readers consuming these tasks should produce deleted records with metadata like change ordinal
 * and commit snapshot ID.

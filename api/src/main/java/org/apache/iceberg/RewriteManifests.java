 * API for rewriting manifests for a table.

 * This API accumulates manifest files, produces a new {@link Snapshot} of the table
 * described only by the manifest files that were added, and commits that snapshot as the
 * current.
 * <p>
 * This API can be used to rewrite matching manifests according to a clustering function as well as
 * to replace specific manifests. Manifests that are deleted or added directly are ignored during
 * the rewrite process. The set of active files in replaced manifests must be the same as in new manifests.
 * <p>
 * When committing, these changes will be applied to the latest table snapshot. Commit conflicts
 * will be resolved by applying the changes to the new latest snapshot and reattempting the commit.

/**
 * API for overwriting files in a table.
 *
 * <p>This API accumulates file additions and produces a new {@link Snapshot} of the table by
 * replacing all the deleted files with the set of additions. This operation is used to implement
 * idempotent writes that always replace a section of a table with new data or update/delete
 * operations that eagerly overwrite files.
 *
 * <p>Overwrites can be validated. The default validation mode is idempotent, meaning the overwrite
 * is correct and should be committed out regardless of other concurrent changes to the table. For
 * example, this can be used for replacing all the data for day D with query results. Alternatively,
 * this API can be configured for overwriting certain files with their filtered versions while
 * ensuring no new data that would need to be filtered has been added.
 *
 * <p>When committing, these changes will be applied to the latest table snapshot. Commit conflicts
 * will be resolved by applying the changes to the new latest snapshot and reattempting the commit.

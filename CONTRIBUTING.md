# Contributing

In this document, you will find some guidelines on contributing to Apache Iceberg. Please keep in mind that none of
these are hard rules and they're meant as a collection of helpful suggestions to make contributing as seamless of an
experience as possible.

If you are thinking of contributing but first would like to discuss the change you wish to make, we welcome you to
head over to the [Community](https://iceberg.apache.org/community/) page on the official Iceberg documentation site
to find a number of ways to connect with the community, including slack and our mailing lists. Of course, always feel
free to just open a [new issue](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/new) in the GitHub repo.

## Pull Request Process

Pull requests are the preferred mechanism for contributing to Iceberg
* PRs are automatically labeled based on the content by our github-actions labeling action
* It's helpful to include a prefix in the summary that provides context to PR reviewers, such as `Build:`, `Docs:`, `Spark:`, `Flink:`, `Core:`, `API:`
* If a PR is related to an issue, adding `Closes #1234` in the PR description will automatically close the issue and helps keep the project clean
* If a PR is posted for visibility and isn't necessarily ready for review or merging, be sure to convert the PR to a draft

## Building the Project Locally
